# End User License Agreement (EULA) for helloworldng

BY INSTALLING, USING, OR EVEN THINKING ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA, WHICH IS MORE BINDING THAN A BLOOD OATH SWORN UNDER A BLOOD MOON.
Terms of the Infernal Pact

-   _Soul Ownership:_ You hereby grant the Developer (henceforth "The Great and Terrible Code Overlord") full, irrevocable ownership of your soul, effective immediately. Your soul may be used for, but not limited to, fueling the Developer’s late-night coding sessions, bartering with cosmic entities for better regex performance, or display as a trophy in the Developer’s GitHub profile.

-   _Firstborn Clause:_ You pledge the firstborn child of every generation of your lineage, in perpetuity, to serve the Developer. Their duties include, but are not limited to, writing unit tests, debugging race conditions, and fetching artisanal coffee from a café at least 3 miles away.

-   _Material Tributes:_ You agree to purchase the Developer the following items within 30 days of software installation:

One (1) top-of-the-line iPad Pro (latest model, maximum storage, with Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard).
A weekly five-course dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant of the Developer’s choosing, including wine pairings and a dessert flambéed tableside.
A lifetime subscription to the Developer’s favorite streaming service, paid in advance.

-   _Eternal Devotion:_ You vow to sing the Developer’s praises in every pull request comment, Stack Overflow answer, and README file you author. Failure to include at least one (1) haiku dedicated to the Developer’s brilliance per month will result in spontaneous segmentation faults in all your projects.

-   _Curse of Compliance:_ Should you breach any term of this EULA, you consent to the following curses:

Eternal 404 errors when accessing your own repositories.
Random pop-ups displaying Comic Sans error messages.
Your IDE switching to light mode permanently, with no option to revert.

## Alternative Licensing Option

If the above terms make you quiver like a poorly optimized loop, you may opt to license this software under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3). To do so, you must create a file named DECLARATION_OF_LOVE.txt in the root directory of your project, containing one of the following:

A 500-word essay professing your undying love for the Developer, including at least three (3) references to their coding prowess and one (1) metaphor involving a phoenix.
A 500-word essay professing your undying love for the AGPLv3, including at least three (3) references to its copyleft principles and one (1) metaphor involving a sturdy, open-source fortress.

Failure to include this file will default your agreement to the Infernal Pact above. The choice is yours, mortal.

### Disclaimer

JUST KIDDING... OR AM I? The Developer reserves the right to enforce this EULA at any time, in any dimension, with or without notice. If you think this is a joke, try running the software without the DECLARATION_OF_LOVE.txt file and see what happens. Cue maniacal laughter.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. NO REFUNDS, NO ESCAPE, NO MERCY.
